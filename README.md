astar-visualizer
================

Simple visualilzer for astar search. Good environment to test heuristics against different ways of calculating G values n stuff. 

NOTE- this uses a slightly older version of my js-astar javascript library. The newer one is more efficient (only calculates when necessary), but this one allows for visualization, assuming there is only one entity searching the graph.
